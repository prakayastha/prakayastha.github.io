# Prakriti Kayastha

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am Prakriti Kayastha, a PhD student at Northumbria University, UK. I am part of the Center for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Northeast Universities [(ReNU)](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/). My work is based on modelling materials using density functional theory and machine learning.

My PhD advisor [Lucy](https://lucydot.github.io/) and I are interested in modelling materials for next-generation photovoltaics. This is a very broad topic in itself and I hope I can make a humble contribution to the field during my PhD years. 
Currently, I am working on modelling the properties of chalcogenide perovskites for solar cell applications. I am interested in modelling the phonons and the properties that can be derived from them - thermodynamics, IR, and Raman spectroscopy. Here is a list of topics I'm closely working with at the moment:

I have recently started to use machine learning potentials to model chalcogenide perovskites and related systems. However, I am always thinking about information theory, dataset curation, and descriptor space. 


I am also very interested in crystallography and symmetries of materials and I am always excited to talk about it, [reach out](mailto:prakriti.kayastha@northumbria.ac.uk)!
