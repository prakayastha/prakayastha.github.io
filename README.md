# Prakriti Kayastha

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am Prakriti Kayastha, a PhD student at Northumbria University, UK. I am part of the Center for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Northeast Universities [(ReNU)](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/). My work is based on modelling materials using density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML).

My PhD advisor [Lucy](https://lucydot.github.io/) and I are interested in modelling materials for next-generation photovoltaics and battery materials. These are very broad topics in themselves and I hope I can make a humble contribution to the field during my PhD years. 
Before starting my PhD, I was part of the [moldis-group](https://moldis-group.github.io/) at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Hyderabad, India. I am particularly interested in crystallography and symmetries of materials and I am always excited to talk about it. 

Currently, I am working on modelling the properties of chalcogenide perovskites for solar cell applications. In particular I am interested in modelling the phonons and the properties that can be derived from them -- thermodynamics, IR and Raman spectroscopy and anharmoncity.
