# Prakriti Kayastha

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am Prakriti Kayastha, a PhD student at Northumbria University, UK. I am part of the Center for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Northeast Universities [(ReNU)](https://renu.northumbria.ac.uk/). My work is based on modelling materials using density functional theory (DFT). I am a computational physicist with an interest in machine learning. 

My PhD advisor [Lucy](https://lucydot.github.io/) and I are interested in modelling materials for next-generation photovoltaics and battery materials. These are very broad topics in themselves and I hope I can make a humble contribution to the field through during my PhD years. 
Before starting my PhD, I was part of the [moldis-group](https://moldis-group.github.io/) at Tata Intitute of Fundamental Research Hyderabad, India. This is where my journey as a researcher began. It is where I developed my own interests in DFT and learnt some machine learning techniques. I am particularly interested in crystallography and symmetries of materials and I am always excited to talk about it. 

Currently, I am working on modelling spectroscopy and thermodynamics of an alternative Pb-based perovskite for solar cell applications. A very bare-bones website is hosted [here](https://prakayastha.github.io/chalcogenide_perovskite/).

Here is a list of my publications:
- The Physical Significance of Imaginary Phonon Modes in Crystals [arXiv (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01244.pdf)
  - Summary: Do not be alarmed if you see imaginary phonon modes in your (converged) calculations! They uncover great physical insights of the underlying potential energy surface and phase transitions of the systems. 
- Quantum Machine Learning Transition Probabilities in Electronic Excitation Spectra across Chemical Space: The Resolution-vs.-Accuracy Dilemma [arXiv (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11798.pdf)
  - Summary: A new dataset for full excited state spectra of molecules in the [GDB](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci600423u) universe. Machine learning of excited state spectra over a range of wavelengths with front-runner representations using kernel ridge regression. 
- Machine learning modeling of materials with a group-subgroup structure [Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/abffe9)
  - Summary: If you have property information from a subgroup, then including some examples from the group can reproduce thier properties (within an acceptable error bar); circumventing the cost of DFT evaluations of the group. 
- High-throughput design of Peierls and charge density wave phases in Q1D organometallic materials [J Chem. Phys. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0041717) 
  - Summary: Using positions of the maximum instability in the phonon mode to determine how many formula units it takes to stabilize Q1D polymers. Peierls and charge density wave phases found available for [data-mining](https://moldis.tifrh.res.in/db/rmq1d). 
- The chemical space of B, N-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Combinatorial enumeration and high-throughput first-principles modeling [J Chem. Phys. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5088083)
  - Summary: The chemical space of of B,N substituted hydrocarbons is huge! 1.2 tera molecules (and even more) huge! These molecules have potential to be good opto-electronic materials available for [data-mining](https://moldis.tifrh.res.in/db/dbbnpah).
